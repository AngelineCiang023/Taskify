# Taskify
I developed Taskify, a simple task-tracking app built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and MySQL, designed to help users record daily tasks and track progress through a clean and intuitive interface.

The app focuses on simplicity, productivity, and an intuitive user experience.

Features:
1. Dashboard :
    - Add new tasks
    - View task list
    - Mark tasks as completed / undo status
    - Edit & delete tasks

2. Task Tracking :
   - Filter tasks by date
   - Calendar-based tracking
   - Daily progress indicator
   - In-progress task count
   - Completion percentage with progress bar
